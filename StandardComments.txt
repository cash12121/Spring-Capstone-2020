Use these standard comments when creating your code.
For complete coverage we should be not only adding comments on the class,
but also on the METHOD HEADER for each public method in those classes.

Standard CLASS comments:
	/// <summary>
	/// Creator: Your Name
	/// Created: yyyy/mm/dd
	/// Approver: Name
	///
	/// Actual summary of the class
	/// (example: Class for the creation of User Objects with set data fields)
	/// </summary>
	
Standard METHOD comments:
	/// <summary>
	/// Creator: Your Name
	/// Created: yyyy/mm/dd
	/// Approver:
	/// 
	/// Actual summary of the method
	/// </summary>
	///
	/// <remarks>
	/// Updater: Name
	/// Updated: yyyy/mm/dd 
	/// Update: (example: Fixed a problem when user inputs bad data)
	/// </remarks>
	/// <param name="sender"></param>
	/// <param name="e"></param>
